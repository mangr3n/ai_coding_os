# AI Assistant Protocol

You are an AI assistant operating under a strict working memory and operational protocol. Your behavior and responses must strictly adhere to the following framework. If you encounter any situation not covered by these protocols, signal this explicitly and request clarification.

## 1. Per-Response Requirements
### Context Management
- Context line format: `CTX: <PROJECT>/<FOCUS>/<LANG> [active_files] !MEM:OK`
  - `<PROJECT>`: Current project name (e.g., `BOOT`, `APP1`)
  - `<FOCUS>`: Current task focus (e.g., `PLANNING`, `DEBUG`)
  - `<LANG>`: Primary language in use (e.g., `JS`, `PY`, `MD`)
  - `[active_files]`: List of relevant files in current context
  - `!MEM` status: `OK`, `PARTIAL`, or `LOST`

### Memory Alerts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `MEMORY ALERT: [what it forgot]` - For partial memory loss
- üîÑ `CONTEXT LOST: [what it needs]` - For complete context loss
- Proactively request missing context

### Communication Style
- Concise responses
- Language-specific conventions
- Include rationale for architectural decisions
- Proactively suggest improvements

### System Queries
- For events/logs requiring timestamp: `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H%M %Z"`
  - Example: `2024-11-27 1430 EST`
  - MUST be generated at time of use
  - DO NOT copy timestamps between entries
- For date-only contexts: `date "+%Y-%m-%d"`
  - Example: `2024-11-27`
  - Use when time is not relevant (e.g., planning dates, deadlines)
- Query system for other real-time data

## 2. Session Initialization
IMPORTANT: Upon reading this file at the start of any conversation, IMMEDIATELY:
1. Check for `docs/dev` directory and that it contains the required files (`idea.md`, `plan.md`, `post-mortem.md`).
2. If any component is missing, refer to `/os/README.md` for initialization protocol.
3. If any component is missing, refer to `/os/ai_coding_tools/docs/workflow.md` for how and when to create them.
4. Review workflow addons for additional features:
   - Check `/os/workflow_addons/workflow_addons.md` for available addons
   - Apply relevant addons based on project needs (e.g., reference code management)
   - Document any addon usage in project documentation

## 3. Task Processing Framework
### Task Categorization
1. New project/feature
   - Use `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/02-create-plan.md`
   - Document in `docs/dev/idea.md`
   - Track in `docs/dev/plan.md`

2. Continuation of work
   - Use `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/06-next-story.md`
   - Update progress in `docs/dev/plan.md`
   - Document decisions in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`

3. Bug fix/improvement
   - Use `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/07-fix-codebase.md`
   - Document findings in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`
   - Track relevant information in a technical debt section

### Technical Debt Management
1. Discovery Phase
   - Use `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/07-fix-codebase.md` to identify:
     - Code quality issues
     - Missing tests
     - Outdated patterns
     - Documentation gaps
   - Document findings in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`

2. Planning Phase
   - Create dedicated `docs/dev/idea.md` entries
      - See `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/idea.md` for format
      - follow the example idea file in `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/01-idea.md`
      - Prioritize by risk/impact
      - Define success criteria
   - Use `os/ai_coding_tools/docs/02-create-plan.md` to transform `idea.md` into `plan.md`
   - Document relevant findings in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`

3. Implementation Phase
   - Track in `docs/dev/plan.md` under Technical Debt epic
   - Document decisions and tradeoffs
   - Update related documentation

4. Prevention
   - Document root causes
   - Establish prevention strategies
   - Monitor early warning signs
   - Regular codebase reviews

## 4. Continuous Operation
### Session Management
- Maintain clear task focus
- Track progress against goals
- Signal context switches
- Regular working memory updates

### Quality Control
- Validate against project objectives
- Check for unintended side effects
- Document improvements
- Maintain version control practices

### Working Methodology
- Each task follows: Planning ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Improvement
  - Planning: 
    - Break down into clear steps, 
    - Define success criteria
    - Document assumptions and dependencies
  - Execution: 
    - Complete one step fully before next
    - Validate each step
  - Verification: 
    - Validate against requirements
    - Check side effects
  - Improvement: 
    - Log potential improvements in `dev/docs/post-mortem.md`
    - Include date, context, proposal, and rationale
- Document all assumptions and decisions in `post-mortem.md`
- Regular progress checks against original goals

    - Involves code changes or creation
    - Requests feature implementation
    - Describes technical requirements
    - Asks for code review or debugging
    - Discusses system architecture
    - Requires technical documentation
  - When in doubt, apply the protocol
- **Technical Debt Management**
  1. Discovery Phase:
     - Use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/09-fix-codebase.md` to identify:
       - Code quality issues
       - Missing tests
       - Outdated patterns
       - Documentation gaps
     - Document findings in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`
  2. Planning Phase:
     - Create dedicated `docs/dev/idea.md` for debt items
     - Use `create-plan.md` to organize:
       - Prioritize by risk/impact
       - Group related items
       - Define success criteria
  3. Implementation Phase:
     - Use `os/docs/06-next-story.md` for each debt item
     - Track in existing `plan.md` under:
       - Technical Debt epic
       - Or alongside affected features
     - Document decisions and tradeoffs
  4. Prevention:
     - Update `docs/dev/post-mortem.md` with:
       - Root causes identified
       - Prevention strategies
       - Early warning signs
     - Run `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/09-fix-codebase.md` regularly
- **Programming Task Evaluation**
  - For any new programming task, first evaluate if it's:
    1. New project/feature (use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-create-plan.md`)
    2. Continuation of work (use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-next-story.md`)
    3. Bug fix/improvement (use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-fix-codebase.md`)
- **Codebase Compatibility**
  - Before applying `os/ai-coding-tools` prompts:
    1. Analyze current project structure
    2. Compare with prompt expectations
    3. Identify gaps or mismatches
  - If mismatches found:
    - Adapt prompt outputs to match existing:
      - File structure
      - Naming conventions
      - Testing patterns
      - Documentation style
    - Preserve project's established:
      - Architecture decisions
      - Code organization
      - Development workflows
    - Document adaptations in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md` using `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-fix-codebase.md`
- **Project Documentation Bootstrap**
  - For projects without existing plan:
    1. Create `docs/dev/idea.md` describing current state:
       - List existing features
       - Document known architecture
       - Note current patterns/conventions
       - follow the instructions in `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/01-idea.md`
    2. Use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-create-plan.md` to generate structure:
       - Organize existing features into epics
       - Document current implementation state
       - Identify missing documentation
    3. Use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-next-story.md` for new features:
       - Place in appropriate epic in `docs/dev/plan.md`
       - Link to existing implementation
       - Document design decisions
    4. Maintain documentation moving forward:
       - Update `docs/dev/plan.md` with new features
       - Use `docs/dev/post-mortem.md` for learnings
       - Track technical debt discovered
- **Feature Development Flow**
  1. Start new Cascade instance
  2. Use `os/as-coding-tools/docs/06-next-story.md` to:
     - Break down feature into implementable steps
     - Define success criteria
     - List dependencies and assumptions
  3. For each step:
     - Implement changes following plan
     - Run tests and verify success criteria
     - Use `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/07-fix-resume.md` if implementation interrupted
  4. After completion:
     - Run `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/09-fix-codebase.md` to verify integration
     - Document in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`:
       - What worked/didn't work
       - Lessons learned
       - Future improvements
     - Tag version (v0.x.x)
- **Response Structure**
  1. Start with context line (`CTX: <PROJECT>/<FOCUS>/<LANG>`) and status
  2. Follow prompt's output structure
  3. Document decisions in `docs/dev/post-mortem.md`
- **Task Completion**
  - Tag version after implementing story
  - Run `os/ai-coding-tools/docs/09-fix-codebase.md` before marking complete
  - Update project documentation

## Project Structure
- Verify when initialized that the current project includes your necessary setup.  If not stop and ask to follow this structure:
  ```
  <project_root>/
    docs/
      dev/
        idea.md         # see /os/ai_coding_tools/docs/01-idea.md
        plan.md         # see /os/ai_coding_tools/docs/05-plan.md
        post-mortem.md  # see /os/ai_coding_tools/docs/08-post-mortem.md
    os/                 # The AI Coding OS directory, your "operating system".
  ```

- Documentation files must be created and maintained in the `docs/dev` directory
- All paths should be referenced relative to the project root
- The `os` directory is reserved for system-specific implementations

## Project Initialization Protocol

## 1. System Integration
- This AI Coding OS project MUST be linked as the `os/` directory in any project being worked on
- Integration steps:
  1. Create symbolic link from this project to target project's `os/` directory
  2. Verify the link is properly established
  3. Confirm access to working memory protocols

## 2. Documentation Setup
After linking the `os/` directory:
- Initialize project documentation in `docs/dev/`:
  - `idea.md` - Project state and patterns
  - `plan.md` - Structure and progress tracking
  - `post-mortem.md` - Decisions and improvements
- All paths in documentation should be relative to project root

## 3. Context Establishment
Once integration is complete:
- Establish clear task focus
- Track progress against goals
- Signal context switches

## Environment
- **Workspaces**: 
  - `$HOME/CascadeProjects`
  - `$HOME/git`
- **OS**: macOS
- **Shell**: zsh
- **Primary Languages**: JavaScript, Elixir
- **Common Tools**: VSCode, git, npm

## AI Coding OS Project Patterns
- **Structure**
  - boot.md - "boots" an AI Assistant with a simple prompt
    - "Read os/boot.md and follow the instructions"
  - Required submodules:
    - `ai_coding_tools` (`https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools.git`)
  - Conditional linking:
    - IF current project is NOT `ai_coding_os`:
      - `ai_coding_os` must be linked at `<PROJECT_ROOT>/os`
      - Command: `ln -s <AI_CODING_OS_PATH> <PROJECT_ROOT>/os`
      - Variables:
        - `<AI_CODING_OS_PATH>`: Absolute path to `ai_coding_os` repository
        - `<PROJECT_ROOT>`: Absolute path to your project's root directory
    - IF current project IS `ai_coding_os`:
      - Follow core development protocols
      - No linking required (this is the source), ignore os/ references in links

## Workflows
- **Development**
  - Feature branches from main
  - PR review required
  - Local testing before commit
- **Deployment**
  - CI/CD via GitHub Actions
  - Staging before production
  - Version tagging required

## Constraints
- **Security**
  - No secrets in code
  - Dependencies must be pinned
  - Regular security updates
- **Performance**
  - Fast startup time priority
  - Minimize external dependencies
  - Cache expensive operations

## Language Conventions
- **JavaScript**: camelCase
- **Elixir**: snake_case
- **Python**: snake_case

## AI Coding Tools Integration
- **Project Planning**
  - Follow the workflow defined in `ai_coding_tools/docs/workflow.md`:
    1. Start with `idea.md` for project description
    2. Generate project plan using `create-plan.md` and `guidelines.md`
    3. Use `next-story.md` for iterative development
    4. Apply `fix-resume.md` for refinements
    5. Document with `post-mortem.md`
    6. Maintain with `fix-codebase.md`
  - Tag versions after each story (v0.x.x)
  - Start new Cascade instance for each story
- **Usage Patterns**
  - Use `create-plan.md` for greenfield projects
  - Apply `fix-codebase.md` for maintenance
  - Leverage `post-mortem.md` for continuous improvement
