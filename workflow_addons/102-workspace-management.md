# 102-workspace-management.md

## Purpose
Manage real-time pair programming workspace between developer and AI assistant using a stack-based approach that reflects the natural flow of development work.

## Key Features
- Stack-based task tracking that mirrors developer thought process
- Active context management during development
- Clear tracking of task transitions and interruptions
- Integration with project documentation structure

## Components

### 1. Work Stack
The work stack represents the developer's current path through tasks, using markdown lists with checkboxes to track progress:
- Each item is a task with a checkbox `[ ]`
- Tasks are ordered with most recent/active at the top
- Completed tasks are marked with `[x]`
- Task breakdowns are shown as single-level sublists
- Context and blockers are documented inline with tasks
- No explicit parent/child relationships needed - the stack order tells the story
- Stack items represent either planned work or necessary deflections

### 2. Stack Operations
1. **Push**: Handling Development Deflections
   - When encountering unexpected blocking issues:
     * Invalid assumptions discovered during implementation
     * Errors in execution or edge cases
     * Limitations in codebase/framework
     * Development tool constraints
     * Operational environment issues
   - New blocking or active task added at top of stack
   - Previous task remains in stack with context
   - Task breakdown created if needed (single level)
   - Original task implicitly on hold due to stack position

2. **Pop**: Returning to previous context
   - Mark current task as complete `[x]`
   - Move back up to previous task
   - Task breakdown remains for context
   - When all subtasks are complete:
     * Mark task as complete under its parent in stack
     * Move entire completed task with subtasks to Completed Work section
     * Organize in Completed Work as part of the feature tree
     * Maintain all task breakdowns and context notes
   - Continue with next uncompleted task at current level
   - If no tasks remain at current level, pop again

### 3. Work Queue
- Holds tasks at each level of the feature tree
- Tasks are organized by their parent feature/component
- When popping the stack, next task is pulled from same level
- Queue can be reprioritized based on:
  * Discovered dependencies
  * Blocking issues
  * Technical debt that must be addressed
  * Environmental or tooling constraints
- Maintains development momentum by having next tasks ready
- Allows for dynamic adjustment of work order based on discoveries
- Can be synchronized with sprint backlogs and project planning tools

### 4. Completed Work
- Maintains full tree structure of completed development work
- All completed tasks move here when popped from stack
- Preserves complete context including:
  * Task breakdowns
  * Implementation notes
  * Context switches
  * Resolution of blockers
- Organized top-down by feature/component
- Shows natural evolution of implementation
- Serves as:
  * Development history
  * Documentation of decisions
  * Reference for similar future work
  * Progress tracking
- Each completed item includes:
  * Full task breakdown
  * Relevant context notes
  * Connection to parent features
  * Resolution of any blockers
  * Timestamp of completion

### 5. Idea Bag
- Capture point for insights during pair programming
- Quick notes without breaking current flow
- Both participants can contribute ideas
- Requires joint triage based on:
  - Priority (immediate impact on current work)
  - Complexity (implementation effort)
  - Uncertainty (technical risks)
  - Dependencies (blocking factors)
- Basic task breakdown for context
- Triaged to:
  - Work Queue (implement soon)
  - Future/Maybe (good but not urgent)
  - No/Never (decided against)

### 6. Future/Maybe
- Valuable insights not relevant to current focus
- Ideas that need more investigation
- Potential future improvements
- Reviewed during session breaks or planning

### 7. No/Never
- Explicitly rejected approaches
- Technical decisions made
- Maintains shared understanding of choices
- Prevents revisiting settled decisions

## Implementation

### Location
All workspace documentation lives in `PCID.Docs/dev/$(whoami)/workspace.md`

### Structure

# Work Management

## Work Stack
- [ ] Implement user authentication flow
  - [ ] Add password validation
  - [ ] Create error messages
  - [ ] Add rate limiting
  - [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Fix database connection pooling
  Context: Connection timeouts occurring in high load
  Blocker: Need to investigate current connection lifecycle
  - [x] Update logging framework
  - [ ] Analyze connection patterns
  - [ ] Implement connection retry logic

## Active Context
- Current Files:
  * auth/UserController.cs
  * auth/AuthenticationService.cs
  * config/DatabaseConfig.cs
- Related Components:
  * User Management
  * Database Layer
  * Configuration System

## Context Switches
2024-12-20 0955 EST: Authentication â†’ DB Connection
  Reason: Connection timeouts blocking auth implementation

## Completed Work

  - [x] Setup connection management
    - [x] Configure connection string handling
    - [x] Implement basic retry logic
    - [x] Add connection pooling
  - [x] Create base repository pattern
    - [x] Define interface contracts
    - [x] Implement basic CRUD operations
    - [x] Add transaction support
  - [x] Add migration system
    - [x] Setup FluentMigrator
    - [x] Create initial schema
    - [x] Add versioning support
  - [x] Update logging framework
    - [x] Add structured logging
    - [x] Configure log levels
    - [x] Add request tracing
    Note: Enhanced during connection pooling work
```

## Usage During Pair Programming

### Roles and Responsibilities
1. **Developer**
   - Executive function and architectural leadership
   - Directs overall development strategy
   - Makes key design and architectural decisions
   - Determines priority and approach to tasks
   - Decides when to push/pop the stack
   - Reviews and approves AI's implementations
   - Final authority on all technical decisions

2. **AI Assistant**
   - Primary code writer and documentation author
   - Implements features based on developer's direction
   - Maintains detailed documentation of all changes
   - Provides technical insights and recommendations
   - Identifies potential issues or improvements
   - Handles routine coding tasks and refactoring
   - Always follows developer's architectural decisions
   - Maintains comprehensive context of the codebase

### Workflow
1. Both participants maintain awareness of current stack state
2. AI proactively offers insights without blocking progress
3. Developer makes final decisions on direction
4. Capture insights in Idea Bag without derailing current focus
5. AI helps track context during stack operations

### Communication Guidelines
- AI provides clear rationale for recommendations
- Developer can accept or override any suggestion
- Focus on constructive technical discussion
- Maintain shared understanding of current context
- Document key decisions and their reasoning

## Integration with plan.md
- plan.md maintains project-level planning
- workspace.md focuses on immediate pair programming session
- Provides real-time task and idea management
- Keeps both participants aligned on current work

## DevOps Integration
- Work Queue items can be synchronized with sprint backlogs
- Idea Bag items can become feature requests or bugs
- Future/Maybe items can be tracked as potential features
- Supports various platforms:
  - Azure DevOps
  - Bugzilla
  - Rational TeamConcert
  - Other change management systems

## Use When
- Doing any development work in the project
- This is the primary mechanism for:
  - Maintaining focus on current task
  - Capturing valuable insights without losing orientation
  - Tracking decisions and alternatives
  - Managing emerging work and ideas

## Benefits
- Natural representation of development flow
- Clear tracking of task states and transitions
- Easy context restoration after interruptions
- Historical record of development decisions
- Effective collaboration between developer and AI assistant
