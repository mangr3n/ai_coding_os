# 1. Documentation Structure Implementation

Date: 2024-12-13

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a systematic approach to documentation and development processes. We need to establish a clear structure for maintaining project documentation, tracking decisions, and managing development workflow.

This documentation structure serves a dual purpose:
1. As an instruction set for AI systems produced by this project
2. As the actual documentation system for this project itself

This recursive nature - where the documentation system both describes and uses itself - provides a practical test case and demonstration of its effectiveness.

## Decision
Implement a structured documentation system with:
- Central docs/dev directory
- Separate directories for ADRs
- Dedicated files for project vision, planning, and retrospectives
- Clear naming conventions and file organization

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved organization of project documentation
- Clear tracking of architectural decisions
- Systematic approach to development
- Better maintainability
- Self-demonstrating system that proves its own effectiveness
- Documentation serves as both specification and implementation

### Negative
- Requires consistent maintenance
- Need to ensure team follows documentation standards
- Additional complexity in maintaining dual-purpose nature
- Changes must consider both instruction and implementation aspects

## Implementation Notes
- Created directory structure following AI Development OS guidelines
- Established initial documentation templates
- Set up ADR tracking system
